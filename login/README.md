# Secure Login

## Mission

Build a secure login that stores your deepest secrets, only revealed once the correct username and password are provided. Use a username and password of your own choosing!

```
$ python login.py
Username: Felix
Password: mintchocolatechip
My deepest secret: 
Mint chocolate chip is the superior ice cream flavor.

$ python login.py
Username: Felix
Password: bluemoon
LOGIN FAILED!
```

## Background Information

Today we will be using conditional statements to create a login system. Remember that conditional statments use operators like ==, >, <, and !=.

Example if-statment:

```
if num > 9:
	print("Double digits")
else:
	print("Single digits")
```

Think about how conditional statments apply to a login. What two things do you need to compare? Which operator(s) will you use?
